## Overview:
This project leverages a Logistic Regression model to predict the strength of a password (weak, medium, strong) based on its characteristics. A Gradio interface is integrated to provide an easy-to-use, interactive tool for users to test the strength of their passwords in real time.

## Features:
  **Logistic Regression Model**: Predicts the strength of passwords based on features such as length, use of special characters, numbers, and letter casing.

**Gradio Interface**: A user-friendly web interface that allows users to input passwords and get immediate feedback on their strength.
